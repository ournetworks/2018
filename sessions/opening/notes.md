# Welcome to State of Our Networks!


# Land Acknowledgement

We would like to acknowledge this sacred land on which Our Networks will take place. Tkaronto (Toronto) has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

_We are grateful to the First Nations House and Elders Circle (Council of Aboriginal Initiatives) for the language that this acknowledgement is based on._

# Code of Conduct

The event has a Code of Conduct in order to foster an environment where we can all work together.

Our Networks is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or technical skill level. In order to reduce obstacles to participation, we have adopted an explicitly-documented code to communicate our expectations for conduct at the event.

During the event if you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, we ask you to contact an organizer or volunteer immediately. Those who wish to do so but donâ€™t feel comfortable talking to the organizers in-person can email coc@ournetworks.ca.

Our full CoC is available online and at registration.
Could organizers and volunteers please stand up and wave so folks see you you are?

# Live Stream and Recording

- We've got a live stream started and this year thanks to the Toronto Mesh group either over HTTP or the peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol IPFS. Yurko will talk more about how it came together (and fingers crossed kept working) Sunday afternoon!
- We have a notice of the live stream and film recording posted at the front: in that we indicate that the area behind the podium will be streamed throughout non-workshop sessions in the main room. The audio from all the microphones will be included. If you do not want to be on film.
- We encourage folks to take photos, however we request that you seek explicit consent by asking permission.
- We also ask that if you are taking photos or recording as part of reportage or a future project you identify that upfront.

# We have a full schedule...

- If you look at the program we have a full schedule both days,
- we'll be ending sessions 5 minutes before the next one is scheduled to start, apologies in advance if that means we cut question periods short.

# ...so remember to take breaks!

- We'll have coffee in the mornings and afternoons both days along with lunch but we are also within walking distance of coffee and snacks
- Please feel free to stop outside during the breaks and whenever you need some space
- There are sets of washrooms in the back to the left of where I am looking
- We also have a single-use washroom by registration so head there for access

# Our Networks isn't just this weekend!

- We kicked off yesterday with a Yami-ichi with our partners Bit Bazaar
- After the weekend we have three days set aside for project sprints (a little bit unconference a little bit prolonged work time)
- And we really tried to think about this event happening situated in a place! Toronto in the summer is full of free festivals, park hangouts, bike rides, patios and sun out late evenings.
- We've pulled together a series of mostly free "afterparties" tonight into next week to try and capture that Toronto feeling
- Online program has a link to the calendar with details and we have it up on the chart paper by registration. Help us add more!

# Would not be possible without our sponsors

Before some brief brief brief remarks on this years theme, I just want to give a huge thank you to our sponsors and partners, as well as our volunteers and my co-organizers

- Internet Society, Protocol Labs and DappHub Dapp.Org folks are Tier 1 Network sponsors for Our Networks
- Maker Dao sponsored the Kickoff Yami-ichi we co-hosted yesterday with Bit Bazaar
- Consensys provided Tier 3 Network sponsorship for Our Networks
- Sticker Mule, Quantum Coffee, and Tyfer bakery provided sponsorship for our swag and food (yesss!)
- Finally, but certainly not least. Mozilla, Semaphore Research Cluster at University of Toronto, and Toronto Media Arts Centre helped us provide our venue

With the above support we've been able to offer sliding scale registration, scholarships, provide food and coffee and plan this event not only a modicum less stress.

# DIWO

Our theme this year is beyond DIY: do it with others.

For many of us, 2017 seemed to catalyze in a moment a slow creep of unease over the internet:

- In December 2017 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to repeal net neutrality
- Further, data extractivism, advertising-as-model, political polarization, far-right populism, extreme weather linked to climate change, as well as force displacement revealed faultlines and fractures in our globalized communication infrastructures and the too few parties mediating our interactions with them

Against this backdrop where setbacks to community-owned accessible, equitable and resilient communications over the internet. And while there have been a growing number of peer-to-peer, decentralized, inclusive, and privacy-respecting projects, in the face of pressure, we wonder what tools and tactics will help us recognize the opportunities and respond to the challenges of this moment?

Drawing on online artists community Furtherfield, we ask "What kinds of creative and critical engagement with technology practices can enable meaningful change when we do it with others?"

Our intent over the next 5 days is to hold space to collectively think, imagine, hope and work together around this question!

Thankfully we are not alone, and this event is timely-- in addition to projects actively building alternatives, a growing conversation is emerging around horizontal, peer-2-peer, and decentralized approached including you all in this room.

Maybe just to end I'll ask/offer a set of evocative questions to carry with us:

- Why decentralization? Do we know why we're interested?
- As a concept it captures imaginations across a plurality of perspectives, how do we nurture it's liberatory potential?
- How does decentralization connect with and work to support projects also taking up the promise of liberation in our communications infra
  - Autonomy and Self-determination in Indigenous Sovereignty (recently held connectivity summit!)
  - Transnational solidarity with Global North and Global South
  - Digital Justice and Equity

# Our

- Who is include in "our"? And historically who has been marginalized or excluded?

# Networks

- How can we play on the ambiguity in the word "networks,"-- recognizing they aren't only technical, but also include networks of relations including people and place?

# END

- I can't wait for the rest of the event to hear what you all have to say :)
- With that, I'll turn it over to our first session!
