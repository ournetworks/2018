Hello [Submittor Name(s)],

Thank you for your "[Session]" submission to Our Networks! 

We are excited to have you participate. [Due to the number of awesome submissions, we are wondering if you would consider the following adjustment to ensure we can fit everything in the schedule:

-

Please let us know as soon as possible if that will work.]

If you are no longer able to attend, please let us know if possible by May 31, 2018.

We anticipate launching registration along with our preliminary program by the end of May. We will send more details for presenters with special registration instructions at that time. Conference details will live at: https://ournetworks.ca/conference/ 

[You indicated you were interested in a community billet, we've reached out to people based in Toronto and will provide more info and assist as possible with matching once registration opens.]

For project sprints we’ve secured space at University of Toronto from 10am–9:30pm Monday thru Wednesday following the conference. To find out more or add a sprint topic (all welcome!) check out: https://ournetworks.ca/sprints/

If you have any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to email us at orga@ournetworks.ca.


On behalf of the Our Networks organizers, we look forward to seeing you in July!

- Dawn
