# Welcome to State of Our Networks!

# We Made It

# Theme

Thank you all for being here for the 2018 State of Our Networks.

Over the past two days we've heard about a variety of community-owned, decentralized, and mesh(ing) projects, hopes, and dreams. I hope many of you have deepened relationships with folks working on similar projects, met folks in person that you've only known online, or made new connections!

We weren't sure what to expect for this second iteration, but thought we could use the closing as a form of "network ops" postmorteum-slash-reflection

# Live Stream and Recording

I wanted to invite Yurko up to provide some details on the stats of live stream!

The next stop with that is mid-August we will have recordings up in various places, update the website and send out an email.

# Organizing

But also, in the spirit of reflection and sharing to with other folks what it might mean to do with others I wanted to peek behind a curtain of how we planned this event (that was kind of left open all along)

---

- We set a few goals for this year:
  - first: increased capacity to 80 up from 40 in our first year
  - second: to hit capacity! Especially to try and convince folks from out of town that Toronto was worth the trip
  - maybe a secret heart goal of excellent swag :)))
- I'm beyond stoked to say we hit those goals, but it wasn't all straightforward

- We wanted to trying and think about how to run an event like this without relying on centralized tools and practices. Needless to say we ran into trouble!! Or, maybe more accurately we navigated a series of compromises yet were able to imagine some form of what a community-coordinate decentralized event might one day become
- however I do want to toot our own horn in some small ways
  - We started planning in earnest in January, through open calls and a public github repository we coordinated todos, took notes for folks to follow along, and publish info including our budget, sponsorship requests and more
  - We were able to offer an honorarium for speakers, recognizing an important form of labour behind these events
  - We offered scholarships!
  - We offered community billets for folks from out of town
  - We went above an beyond in our lanyard game!
- Stuff that was tricky, and where we spent the most time struggling with reconciling our values and existing tools:
  - Receiving proposals from folks interested in talking
  - Handling registration (especially if money is involved)
  - Even website hosting (we self hosted on a droplet) (also on dat!!), collaboration platforms and more
- Grappling with being embedded in a centralized world?

- Things we wanted to do better on:
  - Helping folks with travel costs
  - Drawing in folks who don't see themselves as technical!

I  want to give a huge thank you my co-organizers:
- Garry
- Ben
- Sarah
- Patcon

our volunteers including live streaming folks:
- Shaquilla
- David
- Hank
- Yurko
- Elon

# This isn't really goodbye tho!

- We still have three days set aside for project sprints (a little bit unconference a little bit prolonged work time). We'll convene not at this venue at 10:30 tomorrow morning!

- For those who have to take off tomorrow (but may be around tonight) we are continuing of mostly free "afterparties" tonight

1. At 7 pm, enough time for a dinner, break at wherever you are staying, a sit in a part, we'll be meeting at Trinity Commons for drinks, food available!
2. For those who want to be outside, there is a free movie in Christie Pitt park: In the Mood for love, that starts at sundown, usually good to get there around 8/8:30 to snag a comfy spot.


# Would not be possible without our sponsors

And finally, our sponsors and sponsors:

- Internet Society, Protocol Labs and DappHub Dapp.Org folks are Tier 1 Network sponsors for Our Networks
- Maker Dao sponsored the Kickoff Yami-ichi we co-hosted yesterday with Bit Bazaar
- Consensys provided Tier 3 Network sponsorship for Our Networks
- Sticker Mule, Quantum Coffee, and Tyfer bakery provided sponsorship for our swag and food (yesss!)
- Finally, but certainly not least: Mozilla, Semaphore Research Cluster at University of Toronto, and Toronto Media Arts Centre helped us provide our venue


# See you in 2019
