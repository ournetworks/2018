⚐ SESSION MATERIALS AND SUPPORT

All sessions will have access to a projector and/or screen. Main room sessions will have microphones and a podium as well as a demo table set up at the front. A laptop with presentation software will be set up in the main room but presenters are welcome to use their own device.

Chart paper, markers, post-its and tape will be available for sessions that requested supplies at registration.

In the program sessions are indicated for full :30 and 1:00 hour increments, however we will end sessions on the hour (e.g., 11 am) and leave 10 minutes for switching over. Please plan your sessions accordingly!

Finally, please double check your session timing (https://ournetworks.ca/conference/program/) and let us know if there are any issues ASAP.
