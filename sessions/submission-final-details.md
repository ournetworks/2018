Title: See you this weekend to present at Our Networks ‚ú®üéõüì°

Hello presenters!

As conference organizers we are all excited to welcome you to State of Our Networks 2018 later this week. 

Starting this Friday July 13 we have a kickoff with a free yami-ichi and party 3 pm until midnight. For morning folks, we've also got network field trip at 10 am. 

On Saturday July 14 conference registration opens at 8:30 am, Sunday July 15 registration opens at 9:30am. Below there is more info on our Sprints and a curated list of free Afterpart(ies).

This email has info on session support, honoraria, dietary requirements, our code of conduct, and event accessibility. Let us know if there are any issues and how we can help: orga@ournetworks.ca

‚öê SESSION MATERIALS AND SUPPORT

All sessions will have access to a projector/screen. The main room will have microphones, a speaker podium, and a demo table set up at the front. A laptop with presentation software will be set up in the main room but presenters are welcome to use their own device. 

Chart paper, markers, post-its and tape will be available for sessions that requested supplies at registration.

Sessions are indicated for full :30 and 1:00 hour increments on our program. However while we will start sessions on the hour (e.g., 11 am), we will leave roughly 10 minutes at the end for switching over. Please plan your sessions accordingly!

Finally, please double check your session timing (https://ournetworks.ca/conference/program/) and let us know if there are any issues ASAP.

‚öê HONORARIA

We are able to offer a modest honorarium (a minimum $50 CAD) to presenters which will be distributed after the event. When you register you will be provided with a form to indicate your payment preference and appropriate address.
