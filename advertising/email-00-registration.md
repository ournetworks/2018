Title: Our Networks: Registration open + vend at kickoff Yami-Ichi ‚öë

‚öê REGISTRATION

We are excited to announce that registration is now open for State of Our Networks 2018.

There are three sliding scale admission levels: Organization Supporter, Supporter, and Reduced Cost. The true cost for us to host this event is $57 per person. Your support at or above that price allows us to offer reduced cost admissions and use sponsorship money elsewhere. If it is difficult to attend even at a reduced cost, contact us at orga@ournetworks.ca. We are able to support a limited number of scholarships and are also looking for volunteers interested in helping at the event in return for complimentary admission.
