⚐ PROGRAM

We have a full weekend lined up with an incredible group of presenters. Sessions include:

▶︎ Talks about changing the internet into one we want through migrating to peer-to-peer implementations, building distributed data stewardship, and investigating the tactics of existing protocols
▷ Discussions on transitioning to decentralized projects and imagining what alternatives we want
▶︎ Hands-on workshops for strategizing outreach and organizing at the local scale
