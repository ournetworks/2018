:star: Action Item

SCENE MISSING

- [name=dcwalk] is this CFP enough? at from academic perspective, it's short. (not expecting academics though)
- submissions process (dcwalk)
	- submit PR
	- can direct ppl to follow submission template on github, or via email
	- wanted to support speakers, so holding 2 open dates ([name=patcon] ???)
	- [name=dcwalk] radical networks accomodates multichannel submissions
		- do we want that? keep one and simple?
	    - [name=patcon] suggests perhaps two -- one chosen as the easiest and one that reps our open organizing principles (so submission are public)
	    - [name=dcwalk] forcing them public might intimidate some first-time submitters?
	        - [name=ben/garry] alternatively, public submission might help new submitters feel more comfortable
	- :star: test prose for templating [name=patcon]
	- :star: make decision [name=all]
	- :star: review CFP text [name=dcwalk+all]

- [[name=patcon] finding power] SCENE MISSING

- venue
    - SCENE MISSING
    - [name=dcwalk] in contat with mozilla matt hoy ([name=patcon] ??). definite yes on "wanting to support". but no commitment yet on space. haven't heard back. he is the person who'd book.
    - [name=garry] friend said she could fast-track. might go thru through same person though
    - [name=dcwalk] :star: will send another email
- kickoff event planning (dcwalk)
    - [name=dcwalk]: looked into running it "Internet Yami-Ichi" style. (Internet Black Market) [More details](http://yami-ichi.biz/)
        - around since 2012. lots of support docs of past events. "flea market to sell internet-related things."
        - ben: will we have to section off space?
            - dcwalk: they're often larger, but sometimes smaller. meant to be satellite events.
    - two location suggested
        1. new interaccess space (other event at same time Vector Festical)
        2. Faith/Void. DIY outsider punk media outlet. basement on college near emmett ray.
            - [name=patcon] re: emmett ray. friends who run brewery are openning brewpub with the owners. they could prob beer sponsor. they are wierdos too.
            - :star: ask about interest in sponsoring ([name=patcon])
    - General agreement on excitement over Faith/Void
    - aspire to be as cheap and free as possible while still paying faith void a reasonable fee.
    - :star: have this locked down by april
- :star: signup form creation ([name=garry])
- For NEXT CALL: Budget. Brainstorming/contacting sponsors. Proposed swag (all in Calendar!)
- NOTES: [name=garry] talking to "john kyle" next week
- [name=patcon] fiscal sponsorship? do we need it? have we in past?
    - [name=dcwalk] small amounts probably not? for student events sponsors haven't minded.
    - [name=garry] choose a money person? NEXT CALL
